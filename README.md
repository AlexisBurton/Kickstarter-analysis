# Kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project
The goal is to provide the client with insight as to how the success of Kickstarter campaigns is related to the launch date & size of the fundraising goal.

  ### Project Limitations
  A limitation of the project is the available sample size. Kickstarter is still relatively new, so there are only 9 years of data, and with that short a period, events of a particular year that affected either the campaign creations or outcomes could disproportionally skew the overall trends. As the sample grows, the effect of singular event will contnue to decrease.
  Another limitation is the broad range of the campaigns included in the categories and even subcatergories. The theatre/ play subcatergory has everything from funding a single play to opening a new theatre to funding a traveling production. Each of these tasks have grossly different cost requirements and likely also garner very disparate levels of interest from the contributing population.
  ### Potential Additional Analysis
  In order to further cater to the client's needs, we could continue to filter the data based on their specific parameters. For instance, if they had a fixed start timeframe, we would look at the success rate of the different goal sizes within that quarter, or even month. Conversely, if they were looking for the best time to succesfully reach a particular goal, we would run the outcome based on date analysis for only their goal range.
